# NRMagicCutter

A (very) basic Parabot wooductting script for the server Near Reality.

Cuts magic trees at the magic trees skilling teleport for XP and 150k gp for each log. 
Once the inventory is full, it drops all the logs, and starts over

Start at the magic trees skilling area.

Will eventually add a graphic and other user-friendly features.
